# CellStudio Executable Version

## Overview
This project provides the users a way to run the simulation without giving full access to the engine.

---

## Usage
To run the executable:

Use the provided script to run the program:

```sh
./run_CellStudio.sh
```

To use the `read_output.py` parsing script:

Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system to use the parsing script.
Make a copy of `read_output.py` into the output folder you want to parse.
Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python3 read_output.py ./
```

## Folder Structure
The project folder contains the following important directories and files:

```
project-folder/
├── build/                  # Build folder containing the CellStudio executable
│   ├── CellStudio          # Main executable file
├── libs/                   # Libraries required for the project
├── read_output.py          # Python script to parse the output files generated by the executable
├── run_CellStudio.sh       # Shell script to run the CellStudio executable
```

---

## Configuration
The blackbox version allows limited configuration through the XML file located in the `input/` folder. Modify this file to control how the simulation runs.
Ensure that the XML file is properly updated before running the executable to reflect the desired simulation setup.

---

## Troubleshooting
### Issue: Bash script is not executable.
**Solution**: Run `chmod +x run_CellStudio.sh` to make the script executable.

### Issue: Python script fails to run.
**Solution**: Ensure Python 3 is installed by running `python3 --version`.
